# README

## Introduction

Scripts for getting various data related to Malaysia into CSV since most of them are not in programmer friendly format.

It'd be great if one day people would actually contribute to this repo :)

## Contributing

- You can use any language you like
- Put a README on how to actually run the script
- Make sure there's a ready output for anyone to consume
- Put the output in `output` directory
